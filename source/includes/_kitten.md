# Kittens Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Kittens Authentication

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with a valid API key

```shell
# With shell, you pass an Authoriation header with your API key with each request
curl "https://cats.io/api"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```python
import kittn
api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```plaintext
% kitten-cli auth -h "meowmeowmeow"
```

> You will get back a JSON response like this one:

```json
{
  "scope": "default",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 14400,
  "refresh_token": "8aa0d5d10a39f17d2ba1e269d2d5e1d3",
  "access_token": "64b595f5ab36968ecd35f3192f722816"
}
```

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
